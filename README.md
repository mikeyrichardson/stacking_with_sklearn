## Stacking Diverse Models with Scikit Learn

This project contains an iPython notebook that walks through the process of stacking diverse models to create an ensemble predictor. The notebook only uses simple models since the demonstration is mostly to show how stacking works.

The data used in this example comes from the Kaggle competition Liberty Mutual Group Property Inspection Prediction. More information (including links to download the data) can be found at <https://www.kaggle.com/c/liberty-mutual-group-property-inspection-prediction/data>.
